# ci-cd-pipeline-through-jenkins
In this project, we aimed to streamline our software development process by implementing a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins. Our focus was to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, which resulted in faster and more reliable software delivery.
